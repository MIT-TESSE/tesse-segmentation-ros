## Installation

### TensorRT
This requires TensorRT 6.0.0. To install via a tar file 

* Download a TensorRT tar file compatible with your machine through the [NVIDIA TensorRT page](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
* Unpack the tar file into a directory, `<TRT_DIR>`
* Add the absolute path to the TensorRT `lib` directory to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<TRT_DIR>/lib
```
* Install the Python wheel file matching your Python version.
```sh
cd <TRT_DIR>/python
sudo pip install tensorrt-<TRT_VERSION>-cp<PYTHON_VERSION>-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Install PyCUDA
